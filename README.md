Repository of all the Euler Problems that I complete.
Efficiency is maximized to the extent that I know, and I realize that there maybe more efficient ways
  to complete the problems so please let me know if I can improve upon it!

Currently, I am learning to code with Python so I may not know of the more complicated approaches, but please
  inform me anyways so that I may learn that method and be able to approach latter problems with the solution.
  
Enjoy the solutions!
